              Synaptic Plasticity is known as a synapses’ potential to improve or degrade over time as a 
              response to increased or decreased activity.
              <br>
              <br> 
              Synapse strengthening is an area of neuroscience that is still not understood completely. 
              But it is based on the Hebbian theory which explains when two neurons fire at the same time, 
              their connections are strengthened, making them more likely to fire again in the future.
              <br>
              <br> 
              Synapse strengthening can occur as either short-term potentiation or long-term potentiation.
              <br>
              <br> 
              One of the most well-known reasons for synapse strengthening is an increase of glutamate 
              receptors in the neuron’s membrane.
              <br>
              <br> 
              The interior of the neuron membrane has a different electrical charge from the exterior, 
              and this difference is known as the potential. This potential rapidly rises and falls as 
              the neuron fires (also known as action potential) which allows ions flow from the 
              pre-synaptic neuron to the post-synaptic neuron.
              <br>
              <br>  
              When frequent action potentials occur at the same synapse in rapid succession, 
              more glutamate receptors are inserted into the neuron’s membrane allowing more 
              ions to flow between the pre and post synapses, this increased responsiveness relays to a stronger synaptic connection.
